Data Fetching:
       For this project we didn't provide any actual rest api integration. We have used react-query ~~ hook
       pattern ~~ and fetched data from public json. You will need to edit those hook to integrate your actual API
       end point. Please go to framework/basic-rest/ folder for those hooks.

        Creating the hook:
         We have imported the Product type from @framework/types = framework/basicrest/types (We have used typescript path aliasing for this.
         For more info please see our
          tsconfig.json file). Customize it according to your product type.

         We have built an axios instance which called http.

         We have put all ours endpoint at @framework/utils/api-endpoints file using constant value.
          Customize it according to your api endpoints.

         We have built our product hook using react-query .

            import { Product } from "@framework/types";
            import http from "@framework/utils/http";
            import { API_ENDPOINTS } from "@framework/utils/api-endpoints";
            import { useQuery } from "react-query";
            export const fetchProduct = async (_slug: string) => {
            const { data } = await http.get(`${API_ENDPOINTS.PRODUCT}`);
            return data;
            };
            export const useProductQuery = (slug: string) => {
            return useQuery<Product, Error>([API_ENDPOINTS.PRODUCT, slug], () =>
            fetchProduct(slug)
            );
            };

         Using the hook
            const { data, isLoading, error } = useProductQuery(slug as string);
